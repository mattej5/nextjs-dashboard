Recommended Courses are not required to complete the program
It is recommended that PR students complete one of the following to fulfill the General Education Advanced Writing and Oral Communication requirement. Students who want more writing experience should take COMMS 321 after taking COMMS 320. This is a valuable enhancement class, but the credits do not count towards Public Relations program requirements.
COMMS 321 - Multimedia Reporting 3.0
M COM 320 - Commun in Organiztnl Settings 3.0
PHIL 300 - Philosophical Writing 3.0
WRTG 312 - Persuasive Writing 3.0
WRTG 316 - Technical Communication 3.0
All PR emphasis students are encouraged to become active members of the Public Relations Student Society of America (PRSSA)."
Comparative Literature (BA),"It is strongly recommended that StDev 317 be taken at the end of the sophomore year or the beginning of the junior year. Because liberal arts degrees provide preparation in a variety of useful fields rather than a single career track, this course is recommended to help liberal arts students focus on specific educational and occupational goals and to identify the career options or educational opportunities available to them. The course will introduce them to the resources needed for accessing information about graduate schools, internships, careers, and career development. Students will learn basic employment strategies, including the steps necessary for obtaining employment related to their own specialty.
Acquire a thorough knowledge of two language traditions relevant to individual program of study (one of these may be English for students who emphasize the Anglo-American literary tradition) (approximately 16-32 hours). Competence will normally be demonstrated in course work, but an examination may be required. If planning advanced work in comparative literature, students should gain reading knowledge of both an additional modern language and a classical language.
Complete a reading list (determined in consultation with a faculty advisor) and submit a writing portfolio. During the final semester enroll in CmLit 497 to complete a written examination on the reading list and to have the portfolio reviewed. CmLit 201 & 202, or 211 & 212, are strongly recommended, in part because the reading list core consists of texts treated in these courses. Students who do not complete a literature-based civilization sequence are at a disadvantage in working systematically through the list.
Course configuration must be approved by department advisor.

French Teaching (BA),"This major is designed to prepare students to teach in public schools. To graduate with this major, students are required to complete Utah State Office of Education licensing requirements. To view these requirements go to https://education.byu.edu/advisement/licensure or contact Education Student Services, 350 MCKB, 801-422-3426.
Licensure: This program meets the educational requirements designed to lead to an occupationally required professional license or certificate in the state of Utah. Students pursuing occupations requiring a license or certificate in a state other than Utah should contact the appropriate BYU academic advisement center as well as the licensing agency in the state where they intend to work to seek information and guidance regarding licensure and certification requirements.
Students may declare a French Teaching pre-major by contacting the Liberal Arts Advisement Center (JFSB 1041) at 801-422-3541. The first course will be FLANG 276: Exploration of Teaching Foreign Languages (offered on the first block during Fall and Winter semesters), at the end of which students apply for the French Teaching major through Educator Plus (application procedures are explained during FLANG 276).
Grades below C in any required coursework in a teaching major or teaching minor will not be accepted. Teacher candidates must maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.7 or higher once admitted into the program and to qualify for student teaching. For additional details on admission and retention requirements for teaching majors and teaching minors, see Educator Preparation Program Requirements at https://epp.byu.edu/
A teaching minor in another subject is strongly recommended. Teaching opportunities in public schools may be significantly reduced without a second teaching subject that a teaching minor provides. See https://education.byu.edu/advisement/majors_and_minors.

Portuguese (BA),"- It is strongly recommended that StDev 317, a 2-credit-hour course, be taken at the end of the sophomore year or the beginning of the junior year. Because liberal arts degrees provide preparation in a variety of useful fields rather than a single career track, this course is recommended to help liberal arts students focus on specific educational and occupational goals and to identify the career options or educational opportunities available to them. The course will introduce them to the resources needed for accessing information about graduate schools, internships, careers, and career development. Students will learn basic employment strategies, including the steps necessary for obtaining employment related to their own specialty.

Russian (BA),"- It is strongly recommended that StDev 317, a 2-credit-hour course, be taken at the end of the sophomore year or the beginning of the junior year. Because liberal arts degrees provide preparation in a variety of useful fields rather than a single career track, this course is recommended to help liberal arts students focus on specific educational and occupational goals and to identify the career options or educational opportunities available to them. The course will introduce them to the resources needed for accessing information about graduate schools, internships, careers, and career development. Students will learn basic employment strategies, including the steps necessary for obtaining employment related to their own specialty. HColl 310, a 1-credit hour course, is also recommended at the end of the junior or beginning of the senior year. This course helps students frame their humanities experience as professional preparation. Students will learn how to translate the unique value of their degree as they pursue a variety of professional paths.
