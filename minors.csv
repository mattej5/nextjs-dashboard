Arts in the K-6 Classroom (Minor),"This minor is designed to fulfill requirements necessary for the Utah State Board of Education Arts Integration Endorsement. This minor includes coursework spanning multiple art forms and pedagogies, additional coursework in an area of artistic focus, and coursework related to the integration of arts into the classroom. Successful completion of this minor will prepare students to integrate dance, drama, music, and visual art into other areas of core curriculum taught in elementary classrooms. This minor does not indicate subject area specialization in the arts or qualification for teaching arts courses per se, but rather reflects training in the application of arts-based pedagogies and methodologies to the teaching of other core elementary classroom curricula.
Students completing this minor, along with another education degree pursuant to state educator licensure, should verify with the advisement center in the College of Education that the submission materials for their licensure include their application for Arts Integration endorsement.
